Once the UTD server's "public_html" folder is populated with the files located in this public_html folder, follow the steps on the oit website:

https://www.utdallas.edu/oit/howto/personal-webpage/

to make the recently added files actually public. this is done using the fixmywebsite command on putty. index is the main file. The other html pages accessible through links are seperate html files.

I tried to make a seperate images directory, but the links would no longer work in the smooth operating sense that they do now. this is something that could be explored to make the file structure a little nicer.

Additionally, my site: https://personal.utdallas.edu/~caw180005/

you can view the page source in web browser and have access to all of the html code for the individual page.
