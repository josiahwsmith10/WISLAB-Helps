\section{Greetings}
Welcome students. I hope you find this book as a helpful resource as you are learning the concepts of radar imaging. Over the course of my PhD, I found the resources on near-field radar imaging quite limited, especially when it comes to implementation issues in MATLAB. Thus, I decided to take it upon myself to create a helpful resource for future students in the WISLAB.
